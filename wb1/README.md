# Worker Bee 1

# Prereqs
* Need a secrets.yml file in same directory as wb1.py
```
api_user: ''
api_pass: ''
```
* Install python deps
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# Issues
* Absolutely no error handling. Everything is expected to work 100% of the time. This may leave a submission in a state where it will never be touched again
